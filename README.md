Reminder: The lib-dir has the " SDL2-devel-2.30.10-mingw" compiled version of SDL2 in it. I changed the internal Cmake file, so windows users who are using mingw don't need to put a compiled version of SDL2 on their C-drive. Just cloning this repository and running cmake in a build directory should do the work. Later adding Linux compatible version. Most Linux distros have SDL2 as a package preinstalled. So Cmake will use the internal SDL2 build and not one in the lib package.
